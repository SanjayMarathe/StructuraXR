# VR Vector Placement - Precise Two-Point System

## 🎯 How It Works

The VR vector placement system allows you to precisely create force vectors by specifying:
1. **Start Point** - Where the vector begins
2. **End Point** - Where the vector ends
3. **Depth Control** - Adjust how far the point is from you

## 📋 Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Set Start Point
1. **Point your controller** at where you want the vector to start
2. **Adjust depth** using thumbstick (forward/back) or A/B buttons
3. **Press Trigger** - Green sphere appears at start point

### Step 2: Set End Point
1. **Point your controller** at where you want the vector to end
2. **Adjust depth** using thumbstick (forward/back) or A/B buttons
3. **Press Trigger** - Red sphere appears at end point, vector arrow is created

### Step 3: Vector Created
- Vector arrow appears from start (green) to end (red)
- Vector magnitude is automatically calculated from distance
- Vector direction points from start to end

## 🎮 Controls

| Action | Controller Input |
|--------|----------------|
| Set Start Point | Point + Trigger |
| Set End Point | Point + Trigger (after start) |
| Adjust Depth Forward | Thumbstick Forward (push away) or A/X button |
| Adjust Depth Backward | Thumbstick Backward (pull toward) or B/Y button |
| Cancel Placement | Grip Button |

## 🎨 Visual Indicators

- **Green Sphere** - Start point marker
- **Red Sphere** - End point marker  
- **Cyan Ring** - Depth indicator (shows current depth position)
- **Red Arrow** - Temporary vector preview (while placing)
- **Final Arrow** - Confirmed vector with ID label

## 💡 Tips

- **Depth Range**: 0.5m to 10m from controller
- **Precise Placement**: Use thumbstick for fine depth adjustments
- **Quick Placement**: Use A/B buttons for larger depth changes
- **Visual Feedback**: Watch the cyan ring to see exact depth position
- **Cancel Anytime**: Press Grip to cancel and start over

## 🔄 Workflow Example

```
1. Point controller at ground → Press Trigger
   → Green sphere appears
   
2. Adjust thumbstick forward to move point away
   → Cyan ring shows depth
   
3. Press Trigger again
   → Red sphere appears, arrow preview shows
   
4. Point controller at target location
   → Adjust depth with thumbstick
   
5. Press Trigger
   → Vector created! ✅
